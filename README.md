# Word Counter Widget

Figma Widget - Count the words and characters in any selected layers.

_Creating a new repo instead of turning [the plugin version](https://github.com/Ligerx/figma-word-counter) into a mono repo just out of convenience._

## Info

This repo was created by @figma/create-widget

ESLint and Prettier with Typescript setup with these instructions: https://blog.logrocket.com/linting-typescript-eslint-prettier

## Getting started

Run the following command to start building your widget

```bash
npm run dev
```

1. Log in to your account and open the Figma desktop app
2. You can open any existing FigJam document or create a new one.
3. Go to Menu > Widgets > Development > "Import widget from manifest..."
4. Select the manifest.json in this folder

## Organization

This widget uses:

- [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) for bundling
- [vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [react](https://reactjs.org/) for the iframe
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for typechecking

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| manifest.json | The widget's [manifest.json](https://www.figma.com/widget-docs/widget-manifest/) |
| widget-src/   | Contains the widget code                                                         |
| ui-src/       | Contains the iframe code                                                         |

### `npm run dev`

This is the only command you need to run in development. It will start the following processes for you:

- bundling (both widget and iframe code)
- typechecking (both widget and iframe code)
- vite dev server (for iframe development)

### `npm run build`

This runs bundling with minification turned on. You should run this command before releasing your widget.

### `npm run test`

This runs typechecking and makes sure that your widget builds without errors.
